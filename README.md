The repository contains the code necessary to calculate the optimal non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model. These NPIs are optimal in the sense that they have the minimal effective duration (thus minimizing the societal and economic costs) while maintaining the disease prevalence below a predefined level I_max (e.g., the maximum capacity for the health services for the specific outbreak). See details in the above paper.

Code written by Rodrigo Moreno-Morton, with inputs by Fernando Castaños.
