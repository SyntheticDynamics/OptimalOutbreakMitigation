# OptimalOutbreakMitigation
Repository for the paper "A simple criterion to  design optimal  non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating epidemic outbreaks" by Marco Tulio Angulo, Fernando Castaños, Rodrigo Moreno-Morton, Jorge X. Velasco-Hernandez, and Jaime A. Moreno.

The repository contains the code necessary to calculate the optimal non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model. These NPIs are optimal in the sense that they have the minimal effective duration (thus minimizing the societal and economic costs) while maintaining the disease prevalence below a predefined level I_max (e.g., the maximum capacity for the health services for the specific outbreak). 

Code written by Rodrigo Moreno-Morton, with inputs by Fernando Castaños.
